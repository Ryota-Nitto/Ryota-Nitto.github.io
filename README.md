## Reserch Interests
**Human-Food Interaction (HFI)** 
My current focus is on creating novel taste experiences through the development of mechanical devices that cause human-food interaction. So far, I have developed a device to enhance sweetness without altering sucrose content[3,4] and a device that enhances the sensation of warmth without changing the temperature of the food[1,5]. By understanding how humans perceive taste and leveraging time-series changes in taste stimuli, I aim to revolutionize the culinary landscape.

**Creating new experiences through the application of engineering**
My specialty is in mechanical, electronic and information engineering. I have been creating new experiences by applying these technologies for more than 6 years[2,6,7]. I am passionate about designing innovative mechanical systems that enhance human experiences.
